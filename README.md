# Smart Brain App

In this project I build a full-fledged Smart Brain App that has front end and back end. The front end mainly consists of React and Image Recognition API. The back end has Node server that is built with Express framework. This app has its own database.

Smart Brain App is an application that process an image using its API to detect faces. Once face is detected, a rectangular will be drawn around the face.

When you first land on the website, you are presented with a sign up or sign in form. Once you have signed up and signed in, the next page allows you to enter image and click on detect button to start face detection process.
